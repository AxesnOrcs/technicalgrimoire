My wife, Lauren, has been a part of all the books we've made; reviewing content, giving advice, and teasing my about how badly I use semi-colons. But Bones Deep is the first book that was her idea from the start and one she contributed to the most.

That must be what it's so good! 

Join us for a deep dive into the origins of Bones Deep, some funky trivia, and plans for the future.

**Up-front summary**:

 - Bones Deep was my wife's brainchild from years ago. 
 - Captain Andrew's contributions fleshed out the format and concepts.
 - Other folks added the polish.
 - It was a wild itchfunding success. We can hardly believe it.
 - The PDF will be complete in the next month or so. 
 - Price increases to $15 on January 15th. Get it cheap while you can!
 - Print hopefully coming soon after. 
 - Dice? Expansions? Who knows! 

## Sketchy Origins

Share the pics, other pics, NC holiday pics, talk about the mermaid ideas. Lauren loves it, but I'm too busy with Bone Marshes. I am a fool.

We just finished Lowcountry Crawl. I'm a little burned out and excited for a break. Lauren starts brainstorming. "Let's make something small". Sure. Why not?

## Captain Harrison Enters the Chat

We were excitedly sharing the idea with friends when Andrew spoke up, excited by the possibility.
