While we wait on the next update of Bones Deep (soon!), here are a bunch of other really cool RPGs set under the waves. I interviewed their creators in a halphazard and entirely unprofessional manner. Luckily they were able to...**go with the flow** as it were.

You HOPE that's the last pun. We'll sea. 

I'll be adding in more interview responses as folks get back to me and as I find more RPGs. Be sure to tuna in later for some updates.

## When was the last time you were completely submerged in water?

Starting off with the most important questions. Water we waiting for?

<details>

  <p>'August 2021</p>

  <p>Last month in the Ida Crown Natatorium</p>
</details>
<details>

  <p>I have a reoccurring nightmare of being miles underwater with no sea floor to be seen - so if that counts, a few nights ago! </p>
</details>

## What's the focus of your game? Why set it underwater? Could it work on dry land?

<details>
  <summary>Jeremy Childrey is creating DIVE</summary>
  <p>First, I think underwater stuff is hard because of the lack of content out there, I aim to fix that. Additionally, DIVE is meant to emulate any aquatic horror movie and the first Adventure From The Deepest Trenches includes an Island generator.</p>
</details>

  <summary>Amanda Lee Franck is creating Crush Depth Apparition</summary>
  <p>I keep being interested in boat based micro settings & a submarine is the most dangerous boat possible (kinda pre-sunk). The focus of the game is trying keep the submarine together while dealing with both real world and paranormal dangers.</p>
  <p>It couldn't work on dry land (you could maybe run it in a spaceship? It's going to be pretty early 1900s submarine specific though).</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>L.F. OSR is creating HORIZON RISING</summary>
  <p>It starts out pretty dry! The setting is surrounded by a mysterious growing wall of water that threatens to crash down upon the entire realm, this is more or less a metaphor for the overwhelming feeling of dread that has developed within me when observing the real world around me. Things aren't all doom and gloom, though!</p>
</details>

## How did you make being underwater feel different to players?

<details>
  <summary>Jeremy Childrey is creating DIVE</summary>
  <p>Its very dangerous! It comes with a lot of consequences for mistakes, you have to be careful how fast you ascend, for instance.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Amanda Lee Franck is creating Crush Depth Apparition</summary>
  <p>I'm doing research about the environment on board submarines (sounds, smells, temperatures) and I'm planning a submarine map/character sheet that will have information about how the submarine works and how to fix it when it breaks. Also you can't see out of a submarine, you can only hear what's out there and make guesses. So a hexmap of the ocean  is only revealed to players via the things they can pick up on passive sonar & such.</p>

  <p>The sense of pressure being created by the unrelenting force of the seas, creating a bit of a ticking clock mechanic introduced by the setting itself.</p>
</details>

## If you could have any marine creature as a pet, what would it be? (real or imagined)

<details>
  <summary>Jeremy Childrey is creating DIVE</summary>
  <p>An Octopus for sure!</p>
</details>

  <p>I made friends with a carp in a lake once (gave him a piece of my toast every morning). I hope he's still out there being big & calm. I'd like to have a lake friend again.</p>

  <p>I wouldn't mind teaming up with a whale to take revenge on poachers.</p>

## Anything else you want to add to this wet and weird interview?

<details>
  <summary>Amanda Lee Franck is creating Crush Depth Apparition</summary>
  <p>I just want to say I'm really glad that we're doing a non-kickstarter zine month and maybe eventually we'll all be in like 5 collectives and living in some kinda zine based utopia. Everything has been so hard and dour and I am trying to cling to any hopeful stuff at all and all the community work around this project has been a real hopeful thing.</p>

  <summary>L.F. OSR is creating HORIZON RISING</summary>
  <p>I'm really grateful for anyone taking an interest in any of the projects mentioned here. As someone that played a lot of video games as a child, I can certainly say water-based levels are a love-hate type of deal, but there are some genuinely creative ideas being introduced here and I know there's a lot of fun to be had! Now, where did I put my wet-suit...</p>
